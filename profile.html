   	<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
    	Hello. My name is Aliya. This is my profile page which holds quite a handful of facts about me.
    <br/>
    There isn't much about me except I am 18 years old and waiting to get my SPM results.
   <br/>
     I'm also a middle child among 5 children.

  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
   <p>
   	I have multiple hobbies such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing">drawing</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography">photography</a> and a few others. I have gone through a course for photography back when I was <strong>15 years old</strong>.
   <br/>
    I don't have many hobbies because I tend to get easily bored which is a bad habit of mine. It can be rather alarming to see how fast I can get demotivated about a task or hobby when it turns out to be out of my style of learning or my interests.

   	<ol>
   		<li>speaking <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Sign_Language"> BIM </a></li>

   <h1>Likes and Dislikes</h1>
    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p>
    	I'm not <em>particularly</em> picky about food but I do have a few things that I don't like such as;
    	<ul>
    		<li>durian</li>
    		<li>bitter food</li>
    		<li>anything too sweet</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Books and Movies</h2>
    <p>
    	My interests in things generally go in between anime or maybe K-pop which should be a rather common thing among girls around my age. It isn't <strong> that hard </strong> to understand why my interests lie there as I tend to follow a curve of popularity just like many other kids in my age group. I do, oddly enough, have <em>an interest in horror/gore fictional stories</em> but don't read them as often as I used to.
    </p>

    <p> I don't watch movies that often anymore which means I don't really have any <em>particular</em> genre that I like. I mostly end up watching movies that could be considered more of an art film like <em>Fantastic Mr Fox</em>,<em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> and a few others that I cannot recall anymore.
    </p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
    	I listen to various genres only because quite a majority of my family play instruments such as the drums, the guitar, the ukelele and singing (if you count that as instrument because I do.). I have a rather broad selection of music that I like but I don't have a big favourite as it can drift from many types of genres. It also depends on the factor of popularity and color of sound.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Currently, I am listening to a lot of chill-hop and some J-Rock bands that spark my interests. I do also listen to some anime songs which isn't much of a surprise if you think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
    	A group I've been listening to a lot is a J-Rock group called <em>The Oral Cigarettes</em> and one of my favourite song is "CATCH ME".
